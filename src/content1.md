## **Step 1: Explore the Catalog**

Wouldnt it be great if there was a catalog of ready-to-use enterprise software products and services with a tool to easily deploy them to a Cloud Native environment like Google Kubernetes Engine? HCL SoFy uses Helm technology to provide HCL products and APIs as cloud-ready building blocks.  These catalog products and services are enabled for kubernetes as docker images and helm charts.

To view the entire catalog, select Catalog on the header menu. Click on the dropdown button to change the version, add it to a solution, or click on the card to learn more. The catalog detail page shows important information and documentation for using that product or service. You can also search the catalog by typing keywords in the Search Box.


## **Step 2: Creating a solution**
Creating a solution can be quick and easy. To begin click on **Catalog** tab on the top left and follow the instructions below:

1. Select one or more products and or services from the catalog. Click **ADD TO SOLUTION**.
2. The Solution Panel will pop up on the bottom of the page. Give your solution a name, version, and a description and click **CREATE**.

   **Note:** You can expand the Solution Panel for a more detailed view where you can select or deselect SoFy Common Services.

3. Once your solution is created, you will be taken to the Solution detail page, where you can view the contents of your solution and download the .tgz file.

   **Note:** You have the option to use our in-house sandbox to preview your solution.


## **Step 3: Release to the cloud**
Deliver in a cloud native, container-based environment, thats fast and cost effective. Whether you choose a public cloud, like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or prefer a private platform, like Anthos GKE, SoFy solutions are portable across all Kubernetes environments so you have complete freedom of choice.

After creating your solution with the products and services of your choice, you can preview it our sandbox or use it locally in the cloud of your choice.

1. To preview your solution in the sandbox, click **DEPLOY**. You can either Preview in our sandbox or Download it for local use.
2. Once deployed to the sandbox, you can view your solution in the Solution Console. Click **VIEW SOLUTION CONSOLE**.
